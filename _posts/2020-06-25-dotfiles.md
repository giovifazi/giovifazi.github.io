Here's a closer look at my dotfiles.

## .xinitrc
The capslock key is probably my least used key, but it's also a very easy key to reach. 
The escape key on the other hand is one of my most frequently used keys (I like to use vi bindings everywhere) but it's annoying to reach everytime.
Also the left ctrl key is kinda bothersome to reach when i want to ctrl-c -d or -l in my terminal.

So to arrange those keys in a better, I added the following lines to my .xinitrc:
```
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps

xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'
```

The first one makes the capslock key behave like a ctrl key, so now the ctrl-\* shortcuts are more comfortable.
To solve the escape key problem i used xcape: now a short keypress of the capslock key (without pressing any other key) triggers the escape key behaviour.

**Yeah.. but why bother?**
I know, I know, to many this will look like a stupid thing to change. In the end it's true: those keyboard changes won't make anyone a better sysadmin, nor will save hours of time.
But to me these changes makes things more comfortable and, especially for Vim/emacs users, once you will get used to the new ctrl/escape key, it's difficult to go back.

So, should You also change your keyboard layout? Well it depends (though I dont think there are problematic side effects).
I would say that if you just started using Vi/Emacs or use Vi/Emacs a lot, that's a must: Vim relies heavly on the escape key and emacs ctrl+\* shortcuts are literally painful.
If you just use the terminal or the classic copy paste shortcuts, the new keys arrangement won't make that much of a difference, just a little better; so i suggest to try them for 2 weeks to decide.

## .bashrc
Many of you may not know that the bash edit mode (or the 'terminal' mode as many call) uses the shortcuts from emacs.
In fact there are 2 edit modes to select: emacs (the fdefault) and vi.

```
set -o vi
``` 
that line above will make the bash line kinda like a vim buffer (NB not all commands are supported like ci")

To me that's a great tweak to the command line, but unfortunately the 'clear' shortcut (ctrl+l) doesnt work anymore because it is a vi shortcut.
So in order to preserve the clear screen shortcut, i've added 

```
bind -m vi-insert "\C-l":clear-screen
```

(Note that this works only in insert mode)
